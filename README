A program for automatically generating school reports

This program writes school reports.  It requires a list of comments in a comments bank.  Also a set of grades for various student aptutides are needed.  Once these have been created the code randomly chooses a suitable comment for each pupils. Example datasets are given in the folder called files. The writeReport wrapper script helps users get started.
